    "description": "As a kid i spent most of my childhood playing jrpg and rpgs and getting absorbed in larg worlds. Talking about video game worlds and my favorite characters with my friends where fun, and we discussed what a world would look like if we were the onces making games. That curiosity made me start reserching on howto make a game, programming were one of the requirements, that set my carrer \n\n I currently have a bachelors degree in computer information systems. Through my 4 year ive picked up good programming skills and practiceses. In this 4 years i began to experiment doing game jams to test and build my programming skills  and learn how to work in a group, wich i love, getting the chance to share ideas with other a building something together \n\n On my free time i like working and testing on ideas,that i may one day use for a game, or learn a new engine or a pattern to help with future development. I like sharpening my skilss",
